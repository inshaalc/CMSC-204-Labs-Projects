/*
 * Class: CMSC 204 
 * Instructor: Huseiyn Aygun 
 * Description: In this project you will be creating an application to maintain a network of towns and the roads connecting them. 
 * The application will use Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path algorithm to find the shortest distance between any two towns. 
 * Upload the initial files and your working files to the repository in GitHub you created in Lab 1, in a directory named Assignment6. 
 * Due: 12/1/2024
 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming  assignment independently. 
*  I have not copied the code from a student or any source. 
*  I have not given my code to any student.
*  Print your Name here: Inshaal Chaudhury
